{In this paper, the bases of a semimodule over a commutative semiring R are investigated. Some properties and characterizations of the bases are discussed and some equivalent conditions for a basis to be a free basis in a finitely generated free semimodule over R are given. The different possible cardinalities for a basis in a finitely generated free semimodule over R are considered and some equivalent descriptions are obtained for a commutative semiring R satisfying the property that any two bases for a finitely generated free R-semimodule have the same cardinality. Partial results obtained in the paper develop and generalize the corresponding results for commutative join-semirings and for commutative zerosumfree semirings.

{In this paper, we investigate the free sets and the free subsemimodules in a semimodule over a commutative semiring S. First, we discuss some properties of the free sets and give a sufficient condition for a nonempty finite set to be free in a finitely generated free S-semimodule and obtain a relation between free set and linear independent set in an S-semimodule. Then we consider the free subsemimodules and prove that the rank of any free subsemimodule of a finitely generated S  -semimodule MM does not exceed that of MM. Also, we give some equivalent descriptions for a commutative semiring S to have the property that all nonzero subsemimodules of any finitely generated free S-semimodule are free. Partial results obtained in the paper develop and generalize the corresponding results for modules over rings and linear spaces over fields.

  Most computational problems for matrix semigroups and groups are inherently difficult to solve and even undecidable starting from dimension three. 
  The questions about the decidability and complexity of problems for two-dimensional matrix semigroups remain open and are directly linked with other challenging problems in the field. 
  In this paper we study the computational complexity of the problem of determining whether the identity matrix belongs to a matrix semigroup (the Identity Problem) generated by a finite set of 2 x 2 integral unimodular matrices. 
  The Identity Problem for matrix semigroups is a well-known challenging problem, 
  which has remained open in any dimension until recently. 
  It is currently known that the problem is decidable in dimension two and undecidable starting from dimension four. 
  In particular, we show that the Identity Problem for 2 x 2 integral unimodular matrices is NP-hard by a reduction of the Subset Sum Problem and several new encoding techniques. 
  An upper bound for the nontrivial decidability result by C. Choffrut and J. Karhumaki is unknown. 
  However, we derive a lower bound on the minimum length solution to the Identity Problem for a constructible set of instances, 
  which is exponential in the number of matrices of the generator set and the maximal element of the matrices. 
  This shows that the most obvious candidate for an NP algorithm, 
  which is to guess the shortest sequence of matrices which multiply to give the identity matrix, 
  does not work correctly since the certificate would have a length which is exponential in the size of the instance. 
  Both results lead to a number of corollaries confirming the same bounds for vector reachability, 
  scalar reachability and zero in the right upper corner problems.}
